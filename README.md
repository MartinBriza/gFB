# gFB
GLib-based Facebook chat implementation utilizing the Messenger MQTT protocol.

Based on [bitlbee-facebook by James Geboski](https://github.com/jgeboski/bitlbee-facebook) and parts of the [Bitlbee project](https://github.com/bitlbee/bitlbee).

The port was done in a very hacky way. The dependence on bitlbee internals is subject to change. 

I'm very sorry you have to use qmake to compile it.

Pull requests are more than welcome!

The plugin API itself is exactly the same as Bitlbee's at this point.
